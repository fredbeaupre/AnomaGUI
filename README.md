## To launch the app
Change the `PARTICIPANT_NAME` variable to your name in the `anomagui.py` file.  
  
Run `python anomagui.py` to launch the tkinter app (screenshot above).  
  
For every image displayed, select normal if you think it has a score of 0.70 or above, anormal otherwise. Refer to the images below for examples. If you would like to see more, head to the `examples/` folder. The image's score is in the file name.    
  
Upon selection, the next image will be displayed. Images will continue appearing until all images in the test set are classified, after which the app will close.
  
Once you are done and the app closes, see your results in the file `<your name>.csv`
